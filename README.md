### Note
The windows terminal, namely Command Prompt or Powershell, will have some problems in displaying some characters(present in the game) properly.
To fix this, you have to change code page of your terminal. Type ``chcp 65001`` before running the program. [More Details](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57131654/using-utf-8-encoding-chcp-65001-in-command-prompt-windows-powershell-window)
